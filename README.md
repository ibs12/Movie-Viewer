### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I didn't have as many challenges as I did for the first part, but I found the ajusting the movie grid cell and the image view inside the grid cell very tedious, becuase of it's hard to adjust it and move it around. Also whenever i'm adding a view or moving things around It's very laggy and not very fun to use.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was having trouble with the Images showing up on with the URL I got from the API documentation. But when I used I URL posted on slack it worked

I was getting errors that I had no idea what it wanted because I would forget to name the class 

My biggest challenge was getting Github desktop to work. For some reason when I would drop my project folder into my project repository github desktop would say the folder was empty. I had to play around with and remove the top folder of my project folder. Which ruined my entire project and didn't work anymore. I had to redo the entire project because of that and was more carful moving the files around.
